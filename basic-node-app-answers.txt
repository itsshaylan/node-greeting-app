1. What is a Node module?

A node module is a set of functions to include in your application and they're pretty much the same as JavaScript libraries.

2. What is the main difference between exports and module.exports?

Exports is an EMPTY OBJECT whereas module.exports will pass to it. Module.exports is what require() will return.

3. Why is using exports recommended?

It's convenient so module authors can write less code and it's not returned by require() whereas module.exports is.
